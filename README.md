## Overview
This project was created as part of the Frontend Mentor challenge to help improve my skills and create realistic portfolio ready work.

### The challenge

The challenge is to create an early access landing page.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements
- Receive an error message when the form is submitted if:
  - The `Email address` field is empty should show "Oops! Please add your email"
  - The email is not formatted correctly should show "Oops! Please check your email"

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript


### Useful resources

- [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46155/how-can-i-validate-an-email-address-in-javascript) - This question introduced me to regex and its role in email validation.
- [Official Standard RFC 5322](https://www.regular-expressions.info/email.html) - This is an amazing article which helped me undestand regex by breaking it down in detail, including its limitations.
